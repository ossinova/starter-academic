# Getting Started

## Requirements

* Google Account
* Google Cloud Platform account with a BigQuery project (free trial credits avaialble)
* Database (can use public for tutorial purposes)

If you do not a BigQuery instance. I have a blog post that goes through how you can set up one [here](https://ossinova.me/post/setup-bigquery/)



## Creating a DataStudio report

DataStudio is a very cool and suprisingly user-friendly tool built by Google. It allows for the creation of Dashboards and visualization by connecting a data source such as a CSV file or a database. In this tutorial we will be using BigQuery, another Google product that works very nicely in conjuntion with DataStudio.

Head over to [DataStudio](https://datastudio.google.com/) and log in with your Google account. Create a new empty report and select BigQuery as your connector. Make sure to select the right database and table that you wish to analyze.

Your DataStudio environment shoudl look like this:



# Customizing the report





# Sharing the report

Once you get the hang off DataStudio and its features you can share the report with your co-workers, friends, or clients. There are multiple options in terms of sharing. The easiest option is to share through a link, or by inviting the person to the document and giving them view access. 



Another handy sharing option is to embed the report. Embedding allows you to share the report to your website or web application. This allows for more customization and can easily be integrated into a portal,  admin panel or statistics page.
